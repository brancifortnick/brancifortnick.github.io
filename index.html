					<h2>About Me
					</h2>
					<p>

						I was born and raised in New Jersey, though I traveled often from a young age. I developed a keen interest in
						hospitality and service from my parents, who both worked in the industry.

						Throughout my formative years, I excelled academically and displayed a natural aptitude for the service industry and
						business aspects that surround it.

						During my time obtaining my high school education I began work at Wendy's, where I gained exposure in
						assisting and serving patrons, which ultimately helped me in developing communication skills. This foundational period instilled in me a
						strong
						work ethic and a
						passion for service and hospitality.

						Driven by a desire to broaden my horizons, I transitioned to The Rittenhouse Hotel where I thrived in roles
						such as In room dining server/coordinator and eventually supervisor. Here, I was
						fortunate to contribute to 2 continuous 5 diamond awards.
						This reinforced my commitment to learn, master my craft, and deliver exceptional service.
						
						Beyond my professional endeavors, I am deeply engaged in software and music engineering and development.
						These pursuits allowed me to explore my creativity and passion for
						innovation, which lead me to starting my own business during my college studies. My dedication to these projects
						reflects my
						belief in the importance of getting a difficult task completed, sticking with it, and seeing it through to the end.

						Looking ahead to now, I am eager to continue my journey of growth and impact in Hospitality Management and Tourism,

						I remain inspired by my Mother and Father, whose achievements motivate
						me to strive for excellence and make a positive impact in the world.

						Outside of work, I enjoy time with friends, traveling to new places, and meeting new people. This helps provide me
						with a positive work life balance. These pursuits
						enrich my life and inform my approach to both personal and professional challenges.

						I am grateful for the opportunities I have had thus far and look forward to the exciting
						chapters that lie ahead.

							<a href='https://songs-aa.herokuapp.com/'>Songs Smarter</a>
							<h3>Songs Smarter</h3>
							<p>First full stack solo project. A community where users can upload their personal
								music, have
								other users listen, and comment on their songs. Songs Smarter orignally had a different goal in mind
								so i guess we can call this just songs-aa for now.
								Upcoming Intentions: Adding cart feature, so users can purchase melody stems from other
								users.

							<a href='https://goodtrails-c4d9e6ac08f9.herokuapp.com/'>Good Trails</a>
							<h3>A Goodreads clone</h3>
							<p>First full-stack group project. Good trails gives the user the ability to find trails
								per state, and
								select trails they've visited, or intend on visiting. Good Trails also incorporates a
								rating system and description for these trails, so that the user can choose hiking
								trails, based on their
								skill level.

							<a href="https://medley-aa.herokuapp.com/">Medley</a>
							<h3>Medley</h3>
							<p>For the first time during this solo full-stack project I used AWS s3 buckets for song and image storage
								along with trying out a flask backend , react front end and of course a redux
								store. Users can upload their favorite artists and audio files along with profile
								images, edit, delete, and create biographies about the artist, and browse the community.
								The user has the ability to play music directly from the site
								in comparison to my first project 'Songs Smarter' where I chose to redirect the user off site to listen.
