					<h2>About Me
					</h2>
					<p>Hey there! I'm Nicholas Brancifort and I've focused much of my time and career as a hospitality coordinator
						and
						employee at different leading hotels of the world in an array of selective brands. Most of my time was spent directly
						assisting
						high-profile clientele and VIP guests, which opened doors and opportunities for me. While
						attending college for
						hospitality management, I followed my love for entrepreneurship, and started a small retail
						business. I invented a dual functioning backpack, which acted as your typical school bag, and
						transformed into a beverage-dispensing cooler apparatus. Starting this business taught me
						skills in international shipping and freight, patent law, product design, and business do's and dont's.
						Unexpectedly solving a technical computer error while at work - I got a glimpse of coding and I was 'hooked'.
						The pandemic followed shortly, so I decided
						to pursue academics, and I was accepted to App Academy. My time here
						taught me discipline and the true meaning of teamwork. I developed a stronger, smarter work ethic, built
						personal relationships with some amazing people, and strengthened my ability to work
						constructively in a fast paced and high pressure environment.

							<a>RobinCould under maintenance due to API discontinuation</a>

							<h3>A Robinhood clone</h3>
							<p>This project was a great learning experience and the groups first time utilizing Python
								and Flask.
								My team and I overcame many difficulties throughout this project,
								but managed to complete the difficult tasks..super fulfilling. This was the teams
								first time
								implementing Chart.js, and working with an API for the stock market data which is no longer accessible.
								Upcoming Goals: Chart.js styling, Locate market data API(fix functionality of API curr. code)

							<a href='https://songs-aa.herokuapp.com/'>Songs Smarter</a>
							<h3>Songs Smarter</h3>
							<p>First full stack solo project. A community where users can upload their personal
								music, have
								other users listen, and comment on their songs. Songs Smarter orignally had a different goal in mind
								so i guess we can call this just songs-aa for now.
								Upcoming Intentions: Adding cart feature, so users can purchase melody stems from other
								users.

							<a href='https://goodtrailss-aa-11462f77aa53.herokuapp.com/'>Good Trails</a>
							<h3>A Goodreads clone</h3>
							<p>First full-stack group project. Good trails gives the user the ability to find trails
								per state, and
								select trails they've visited, or intend on visiting. Good Trails also incorporates a
								rating system and description for these trails, so that the user can choose hiking
								trails, based on their
								skill level.

							<a href="https://medley-aa.herokuapp.com/">Medley</a>
							<h3>Medley</h3>
							<p>For the first time during this solo full-stack project I used AWS s3 buckets for song and image storage
								along with trying out a flask backend , react front end and of course a redux
								store. Users can upload their favorite artists and audio files along with profile
								images, edit, delete, and create biographies about the artist, and browse the community.
								The user has the ability to play music directly from the site
								in comparison to my first project 'Songs Smarter' where I chose to redirect the user off site to listen.
