					<h2>About Me
					</h2>
					<p>

					I was born and raised in New Jersey and grew up inspired by my parents’ careers in hospitality. Early on, I gained customer service experience at Wendy’s, where I developed communication skills and a strong work ethic. My career advanced at The Rittenhouse Hotel, where I served in dining, coordination, and supervisory roles, contributing to two consecutive 5 Diamond Awards.

Alongside hospitality, I explored software and music engineering, eventually starting my own business during college. These ventures strengthened my creativity, discipline, and problem-solving skills.

Today, I am eager to continue growing in Hospitality Management and Tourism, motivated by my parents’ example and a passion for delivering exceptional service. Outside of work, I enjoy traveling, meeting new people, and spending time with friends, which helps me maintain a healthy work-life balance.

							<a href='https://find-trails.com'>Find Trails</a>
							<h3>A Goodreads clone</h3>
							<p>First full-stack group project called good trails was written in Pug and Express and changed to find-trails.com recently. The application is now using Python and React. Find trails gives the user the ability to find trails
								per state, and
								select trails they've visited, or intend on visiting, while having the option to view their personal collections. 
								Find Trails also incorporates a
								rating system and description for these trails, so that the user can choose hiking
								trails, based on their
								skill level, and desired destination. Users also have the ability to write reviews on the trails.

							<h3>A Cheeseteak rating app</h3>
							<p>This project utilitzes React, Redux, Flask, PostgreSQL, Heroku, CSS, Docker.
							This project isn't fully complete, 
							but most components are deplployed - 
							the basic functionality is here now - but 
							later : to include maps for address section in one of the upload components.
						 	Recently was steaklocate, but have completed the voting feature for the application.

							<h3> Robin Could </h3>
						<p>RobinCould was a group project in week 18 where we decided to clone robinhood. 
							The API our team used is no longer functional, so unfortunately there is no website.  You may find more information, and some images from the application on my Github.
							Users have the ability to purchase and sell stocks, add and remove stocks from their watchlist, and review key market information.  The site used ChartJS for visualizing the markets current data trends, and contained a search component that used regex for searching for the users preferred stocks.

							<a href="https://medleystorage.com/">Medley Storage</a>
							<h3>Medley</h3>
							<p>For the first time during this solo full-stack project I used AWS s3 buckets for song and image storage
								along with trying out a flask backend , react front end and of course a redux
								store. Users can upload their favorite artists and audio files along with profile
								images, edit, delete, and create biographies about the artist, and browse the community.
								The user has the ability to play music directly from the site
								in comparison to my first project 'Songs Smarter' where I chose to redirect the user off site to listen.

							<a href='https://songs-aa.herokuapp.com/'>Songs Smarter</a>
							<h3>Songs Smarter</h3>
							<p>First full stack solo project. A community where users can upload their personal
								music, have
								other users listen, and comment on their songs. Songs Smarter orignally had a different goal in mind
								so i guess we can call this just songs-aa for now.
								Upcoming Intentions: Adding cart feature, so users can purchase melody stems from other
								users.

							<a href='https://in-room-dining.com/'>In Room Dining</a>
							<h3>In Room Dining</h3>
							<p>In-Room Dining is a web application developed to streamline employee onboarding by providing structured access to menu data, shift protocols, workflow documentation, and duty requirements. The application features a front-end–focused architecture, with a Flask backend implemented solely for user authentication processes, including secure sign-up and login endpoints.
								Due to corporate guidelines the site is no longer accessible, but will be rolling out another version in the near future.
