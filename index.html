					<h2>About Me
					</h2>
					<p>Hey there! I'm Nicholas Brancifort and I've spent most of my career as a hospitality coordinator and
						associate at some of the leading hotels in the world. Most of my time was spent directly assisting
						high-profile clientele and VIP guests, which in turn, opened many opportunities for me. While attending college for
						hospitality management, I followed my love for entrepreneurship, and started a small retail
						business. I invented a dual functioning backpack, which acted as your typical school bag, and
						transformed into a beverage-dispensing cooler apparatus. Starting my first business taught me skills in international shipping and freight, patent law, and product design. While solving a problem in my
						most previous position, I got a taste for the power of coding and I was 'hooked'. Soon after, the pandemic occurred, so I decided
						to pursue a new career path and joined App Academy. My time here
						taught me discipline and the true meaning of teamwork. I developed a stronger work ethic, built personal relationships with some amazing people, and strengthened my ability to work constructively in a fast paced and high pressure environment.

							<a href="https://robinhood-aa.herokuapp.com/">Robin Could</a>
							<h3>A Robinhood clone</h3>
							<p>This project was a great learning experience and the groups first time utilizing Python
								and Flask.
								My team and I overcame many difficulties throughout this project,
								but managed to pull it off just in time, which was very exciting. This was the teams
								first time
								implementing Chart.js, and working with an API for the stock market data.
								Upcoming Intentions: Chart.js styling.

							<a href='https://songs-aa.herokuapp.com/'>Songs Smarter</a>
							<h3>Songs Smarter</h3>
							<p>My first full stack solo project. A community where users can upload their personal
								music, have
								other users listen, and comment on their songs.
								Upcoming Intentions: Adding cart feature, so users can purchase melody stems from other
								users.

							<a href='https://good-trails.herokuapp.com/'>Good Trails</a>
							<h3>A Goodreads clone</h3>
							<p>My first full-stack group project. Good trails gives the user the ability to find trails
								per state, and
								select trails they've visited, or intend on visiting. Good Trails also incorporates a
								rating system and description for these trails, so that the user can choose hiking
								trails, based on their
								skill level.

							<a href="https://medley-aa.herokuapp.com/">Medley</a>
							<h3>Medley</h3>
							<p>This is my first full-stack project using AWS for song and image storage. This is also my first application where I am using a flask backend with a react front end and redux store. Users can upload their favorite artists and audio files along with profile images.  The user has the ability to play music directly from the site.
