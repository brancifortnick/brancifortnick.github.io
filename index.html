					<h2>About Me
					</h2>
					<p>

					I was born and raised in New Jersey and grew up inspired by my parents’ careers in hospitality. Early on, I gained customer service experience at Wendy’s, where I developed communication skills and a strong work ethic. My career advanced at The Rittenhouse Hotel, where I served in dining, coordination, and supervisory roles, contributing to two consecutive 5 Diamond Awards.

Alongside hospitality, I explored software and music engineering, eventually starting my own business during college. These ventures strengthened my creativity, discipline, and problem-solving skills.

Today, I am eager to continue growing in Hospitality Management and Tourism, motivated by my parents’ example and a passion for delivering exceptional service. Outside of work, I enjoy traveling, meeting new people, and spending time with friends, which helps me maintain a healthy work-life balance.

							<h3>A Trail Discovery Platform</h3>
							<p>Originally developed as a full-stack group project called Good Trails using Pug and Express, this application was reimagined as a solo project and rebuilt with Python and React. Find Trails enables users to discover hiking trails by state, track trails they've visited or plan to visit, and organize them into personal collections. The platform features a comprehensive rating system and detailed trail descriptions, allowing users to select hikes based on skill level and desired destination. Users can also share their experiences by writing and reading trail reviews.

							<h3>A Music Streaming Community</h3>
							<p>A solo full-stack project built with Flask, React, and Redux, featuring AWS S3 integration for secure song and image storage. Users can upload their favorite artists along with audio files and profile images, create and edit artist biographies, and explore content shared by the community. Unlike previous projects, Medley Storage allows users to stream music directly on the platform, providing a seamless listening experience without external redirects.

							<h3>A Music Sharing Community</h3>
							<p>My first full-stack solo project, Songs Smarter is a community platform where musicians can upload their original music, share it with other users, and receive feedback through comments. This project served as a foundation for exploring full-stack development concepts. Future enhancements include implementing a marketplace feature that will allow users to buy and sell melody stems, creating opportunities for collaboration and monetization within the creative community.

Built with React, Redux, Flask, and PostgreSQL, this application features user authentication, watchlists, portfolio management, and live stock data integration. Please note that due to API rate limiting on the free tier, some stock data may be cached or limited to ensure optimal performance and availability for all users.
