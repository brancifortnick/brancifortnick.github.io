					<h2>About Me
					</h2>
					<p>

					I was born and raised in New Jersey and grew up inspired by my parents’ careers in hospitality. Early on, I gained customer service experience at Wendy’s, where I developed communication skills and a strong work ethic. My career advanced at The Rittenhouse Hotel, where I served in dining, coordination, and supervisory roles, contributing to two consecutive 5 Diamond Awards.

Alongside hospitality, I explored software and music engineering, eventually starting my own business during college. These ventures strengthened my creativity, discipline, and problem-solving skills.

Today, I am eager to continue growing in Hospitality Management and Tourism, motivated by my parents’ example and a passion for delivering exceptional service. Outside of work, I enjoy traveling, meeting new people, and spending time with friends, which helps me maintain a healthy work-life balance.

							<a href='https://songs-aa.herokuapp.com/'>Songs Smarter</a>
							<h3>Songs Smarter</h3>
							<p>First full stack solo project. A community where users can upload their personal
								music, have
								other users listen, and comment on their songs. Songs Smarter orignally had a different goal in mind
								so i guess we can call this just songs-aa for now.
								Upcoming Intentions: Adding cart feature, so users can purchase melody stems from other
								users.

							<a href='https://goodtrails-c4d9e6ac08f9.herokuapp.com/'>Good Trails</a>
							<h3>A Goodreads clone</h3>
							<p>First full-stack group project. Good trails gives the user the ability to find trails
								per state, and
								select trails they've visited, or intend on visiting. Good Trails also incorporates a
								rating system and description for these trails, so that the user can choose hiking
								trails, based on their
								skill level.

							<a href="https://medley-aa.herokuapp.com/">Medley</a>
							<h3>Medley</h3>
							<p>For the first time during this solo full-stack project I used AWS s3 buckets for song and image storage
								along with trying out a flask backend , react front end and of course a redux
								store. Users can upload their favorite artists and audio files along with profile
								images, edit, delete, and create biographies about the artist, and browse the community.
								The user has the ability to play music directly from the site
								in comparison to my first project 'Songs Smarter' where I chose to redirect the user off site to listen.
