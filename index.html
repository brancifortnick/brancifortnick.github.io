					<h2>About Me
					</h2>
					<p>Hey there! I'm Nicholas Brancifort and I spent most of my career as a hospitality coordinator and
						associate at some of the leading hotels in the world. During my time in the industry, I dealt
						with high profile clients which opened many opportunities for me. While Attending college for
						hospitality management, I followed my passion for entrepreneurship, and started a small retail
						business. I invented a dual functioning backpack which both acted as your typical school bag and
						transformed into a beverage dispensing cooler. Starting my first business gave me skills in
						international shipping, patent law, product design and accounting. While solving a problem in my
						previous hospitality position, I got a taste for the power of coding. When Covid hit, I decided
						to pursue my new passion and found App Academy and a love for programming. My time at App Academy
						taught me how to deal with a fast paced, high pressure and high stress enviornment.
